📘 AI + AGI Powered Educational Organization & Campus Control System
📌 Overview

This project is a 1-year capstone project that aims to build a cost-free, AI + AGI-inspired platform for managing education and full campus administration.
The system integrates AI tutoring, faculty assistance, and administrative automation into one intelligent solution. It is designed using free and open-source tools only.

Key Features:

Personalized AI tutor for students (chat, voice, video-based learning)

Automated timetable, attendance (face recognition), and academic management

Faculty assistance for lesson planning and student evaluation

Full campus control: fees, hostel, transport, infrastructure, and security

Predictive analytics for administrators (dropouts, performance trends, resources)

AGI-inspired reasoning (multi-agent decision-making using LangChain, AutoGPT)

🎯 Objectives

Build a cross-platform system (Web, Mobile, Desktop) with Flutter.

Integrate AI models for student learning & faculty support.

Automate campus administration including academics, finance, and resources.

Simulate AGI-level reasoning for smart decision-making.

Use only free/open-source resources.

🏫 Scope

Suitable for schools, colleges, and universities.

Scalable as a SaaS product.

Modules: Student, Faculty, Admin, Campus Controller (AGI).

Includes academic + non-academic campus operations.

🏗️ System Architecture

Layers:

Frontend → Flutter (cross-platform app for Students, Faculty, Admins, Parents).

Backend → Python (FastAPI/Django REST APIs).

AI/AGI Layer → Hugging Face models, LangChain multi-agent reasoning, AutoGPT/CrewAI.

Database → Firebase (auth, notifications), PostgreSQL (storage).
